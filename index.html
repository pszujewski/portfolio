              I'm a web developer and recent graduate of the Front End Web 
              Development Bootcamp at Thinkful. I love coding because there 
              is no better puzzle than a complicated and nuanced bug.
              If I'm not coding, I might be traveling somewhere new. I'm lucky to have 
              had a wealth of international experiences that have broadened
              my perspectives and opened me up to the world.

              My personal motto is 'stay curious' because I believe that true 
              intelligence is born of deep curiosity.
